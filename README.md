# Expression Calculator

In this repository I am going to save one project I did for university. It would be an expression calculator (boolean expressions). The code or comments are done in spanish since it was for my university.

#### Example

What does code can do would be the following:

Calculate the result of this boolean expression and also print information like the hierarchy tree of the logical expression.
```
(T*F)-F
```

## How it works ?

You just need to run the code and then enter your expression. For example, it could be: `T+F`.
Another example could be:
```
F-F*(F+T)
```
